# Luke Theme

Luke is a minimalist, modular, and highly customisable Jekyll theme for those who want a basic scaffold to create their *own* website.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Ryohskay/jekyll-theme-luke.git`
2. Change git origin: `git remote set-url origin [YOUR-PROJECT-REPO-URL]`
3. {Optional} Add this repo as an `upstream` repo in case the theme gets updates: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ryohskay/jekyll-theme-luke.git`

By running the third command, you can receive updates to your theme by `git pull --rebase upstream main` (But you might get tons of merge conflicts).
