# Luke Theme

Luke is a minimalist, modular, and highly customisable Jekyll theme for those who want a basic scaffold to create their *own* website.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- `ruby` (and `gem`)
- `jekyll`
- Node.js
  - Make sure that `yarn` is available. Run `corepack enable yarn` to enable yarn.

### Install

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Ryohskay/jekyll-theme-luke.git`
2. Set up the project: `yarn install && bundle install`
3. Change git origin: `git remote set-url origin [YOUR-PROJECT-REPO-URL]`
4. {Optional} Add this repo as an `upstream` repo in case the theme gets updates: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ryohskay/jekyll-theme-luke.git`

By running 4., you can receive updates to your theme by `git pull --rebase upstream main` (But you might get tons of merge conflicts).
