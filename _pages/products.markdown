## Our Flagship Product

Our flagship product is our custom Jekyll theme: *Luke*.

![Luke logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/luke_theme_logo_trimmed.jpeg)

### Modular Implementation

It's a highly customisable theme which you can smoothly implement on and deploy to any platform:
you simply get html, css, and js files, so you can control how you publish your website.

### (Human) Language-agnostic

Luke theme is modularised, so you can customise almost any words on the template, and you can
express yourself beyond the limitations of standardised blank languages.

Even if you want to create a website in rare and unrepresented languages like
*Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim* or *Kalaallisut* with Jekyll, you can do that easily (but be careful with fonts).
